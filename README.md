# IoT 

All the above projects are only based on Aurdino board projects in future other projects will came...

# Note: 
In some programs i skiped the registers because in my system they work without registers so if any warning was ditected you just add registers
## Optimizations

I used different colours for different wires, I think this is very easy to learn and i already reduced the complexity of diagram.
